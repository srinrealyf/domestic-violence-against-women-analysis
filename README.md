# Domestic Violence Against Women - Case Study

**Project Description**

This project aims to analyze the incidence of domestic violence against women in a specific rural area of a developing country. The dataset includes socio-economic factors to help understand the correlation between these factors and domestic violence. The goal is to provide insights that can inform effective interventions and policies.

**Dataset Content**

Dataset from Kaggle by Fahimda Choudary - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fahmidachowdhury/domestic-violence-against-women

- Marital status: Marital status of the respondent (married or unmarried).
- Violence: Indicates whether the respondent has experienced domestic violence (yes or no).

**Context**

Domestic violence against women is a significant issue in many developing countries. Understanding the factors that contribute to this violence can help in creating effective interventions and policies. This dataset aims to provide a basis for analysis and research in this critical area.

**Objectives**

The dataset can be used to:

- Analyze the correlation between education level and domestic violence.
- Study the impact of marital status on domestic violence.
- Explore the age distribution of domestic violence victims.
- Identify potential socio-economic factors contributing to domestic violence.

**Key Findings**

- Income and Domestic Violence: Individuals who experienced domestic violence consistently showed lower income levels compared to those who did not, irrespective of marital or employment status.
- Marital Status Impact: Unmarried victims showed a pronounced skew towards lower income brackets.
- Employment Status Influence: Unemployed and semi-employed victims had notably lower incomes.
- Age and Domestic Violence: Incidence peaked in the 20s and 30s, declining with age.

**Chart Analysis**

- Violin plots and swarm plots were used to analyze the distribution of domestic violence incidence by age.
- Strip plots were used to analyze income distribution by marital status and employment status in relation to domestic violence.

**How to Use This Project**
